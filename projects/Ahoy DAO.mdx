slug: Ahoy is a next-generation peer-to-peer ecosystem designed for the ownership economy of the marine industry. Setting the standard for marine-based Web3 applications, Ahoy decentralizes boat ownership, renting, slipping, and financing, thus lowering the barriers to entry for recreational boating and bettering the overall boating experience for everyone. Ahoy is removing traditional barriers, standardizing business systems, eliminating friction, reducing costs, and creating opportunities for engagement across the entire boating ecosystem. Leveraging DeFi to advance the global trade of marine assets and membership DAO to foster IRL social boating privileges.
