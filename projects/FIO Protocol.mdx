slug: The (FIO) Protocol is a blockchain that enables easier, safer and more joyful crypto transactions on any type of token or coin. It serves as a usability layer for the entire blockchain ecosystem enabling, among other things, human readable wallet names that replace complex public addresses, the ability to request crypto payments versus just sending and the ability to include data such as notes, order carts or invoices alongside crypto transactions on every blockchain. The Foundation for Interwallet Operability is an industry guided non-profit entity whose mission is to facilitate improvement to and adoption of the FIO Protocol. Many of the industryâ€™s leading wallets and exchanges have integrated the FIO protocol thereby enabling access to its capabilities for their users which, combined, represent millions of people.
